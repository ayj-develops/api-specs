## AYJ Club Platform API v0.1

The AYJ Club Platform API is structured around [REST]() and the API provides a set of urls for other apps to interact with.

The AYJ Club Platform API accepts [form-encoded]() data, [multi-part form]() data, and returns [JSON-encoded]() responses. It also uses standard [HTTP status codes](), authentication, and verbs.


## General

The application making the request to this server requires a valid API key. This key is shared only by the development team. Additionally, the request must include an access_token generated by a valid google account from Firebase. This token is decoded and verified on the server before the request is passed through.

All API responses are JSON encoded and every response is returned in a [common object]() format for easier parsing and consistency. Please refer to the [response format]() documentation for more details.

Parameter names take in only one value, regardless of plurality. For example, the `id` parameter within `users/{id}/favourites` vs `user/{id}/favourites`, will only be a single id, regardless of 'users' vs 'user'.

Queries can be performed through the API directly, and they are defined in each endpoint documentation page. Additionally, API responses will be compressed.
