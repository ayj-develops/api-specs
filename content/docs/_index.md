The AYJ Club Platform API is structured around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and the API provides a set of urls for other apps to interact with.

The AYJ Club Platform API **accepts** [form-encoded data](), [multi-part form data](), and returns [JSON-encoded]() responses. It also uses standard [HTTP status codes](), authentication, and verbs.
